      <h2><center>Sultry, dark and highly conceptualized, Dean’s music and visuals build nostalgia with every layer. Elements of Nineties R&B, old-school funk and jazz make themselves known all through his 2016 debut EP 130: mood TRBL, while several references to American films and pop culture appear in its accompanying music videos. “Bonnie and Clyde” is an encapsulation of his artistic style; it depicts the tragic story of the infamous villains of the same name, but is reimagined to take place sometime in the Eighties (the presence of VHS cassettes and old technology hint at the same.) While all the visual symbolism plays a key part in crafting his image, Dean says he hasn’t been as involved in the actual process of creating it as he would have liked. “I have participated in some of the work, not all of it,” he admits. “But from now on, I’m going to try to put as many of my thoughts and ideas as possible into the overall process of music making, be it the artwork, photo, styling, or the music video.”Dean’s touch is prominent in the music. He prefers ”˜listening’ to films rather than watching them, and his sound design for the tracks on 130: mood TRBL seeks to achieve a similar effect. “Since each of my songs tells a story, it’s my intention for you to be able to picture them in your head when you listen to my music,” he explains. The several sounds featured include police sirens, dial tones, tape recorders, his breathing, footsteps and more. The result of these things coming together is the creation of a grander picture, the story of a love found and then lost- perhaps drawn from his real life. “There is endless inspiration to get from our personal lives and so about 90 percent of the inspiration forÂ 130 mood: TRBLÂ came from myÂ personal experiences,” Dean confirms, but is unwilling to reveal too much.
        he highly conceptual EP begins with the outro, “And You?” and proceeds to reveal a chain of events that take place backwards; it starts with the end of the relationship and ends with the moment he first fell in love. “The initial idea about the outro, as you might have guessed from seeing my Instagram, came from the fact that I like to look at things upside down,” says Dean. “So when I was making this song, I thought why not start with an outro?” The conceptualization continues on his most recent work, Limbo. The two-track single, which released on February 16th, draws on concepts from Christopher Nolan’s 2010 masterpiece Inception. “This time around, I wanted to mix some not-so-common sounds and express what I feel about limbo, as in the concept of Inception which I understand as the process of transferring from reality to dreams,” he explains.
        Although his songs are mostly in Korean, it doesn’t deter international fans from connecting to them. According to Dean, if the music is good, the urge to listen and learn more will always be present. “I want to continue to make good albums so that people who don’t speak Korean will want to translate my lyrics into their own languages to get to know my music better.” He reveals that he used to do the same thing with N.E.R.D. (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo’s hip-hop project.) “I translated the English lyrics to Korean because I liked the music so much.”
        Currently working on a follow-up to the 130 mood series titled 130 mood: JNGL, Dean is determined to outdo himself this year. “It’s going to be more solid and specific in terms of storytelling,” he says about the upcoming album. “As always, I want to communicate through my musicÂ as a whole album and I want my fans in India and other parts of the world to be able to catch that.”-Rolling Stone India

<h4><center>Meet Dean, the rising star bringing Korean R&B to the world</center></h4

<h4><center>/TEXT TAYLOR GLASBY/</center></h4>
<p><b>Taylor Glasby: There are several accounts of you singing since you were very young and through high school but didn’t decide to pursue music until when you were twenty. What’s the most accurate representation of your journey into music as a full-time career?
</b></p>
<p>Dean: I loved painting and writing ever since I was a child, but I always had a hard time staying focused on one thing for a long time. When I started recording music at home, making beats, and rapping I knew that I must really like it because I could do it all day. So, I started writing songs. A producer heard some of my music and suggested we start working together and that was the start of my music career.
</p>
<p><b> Taylor: You named yourself after James Dean and your EP, 130 Mood: TRBL after the number on his Porsche Spyder. How long have you be interested by him and do you see in him something you see in yourself?
</b></p>
<p>Dean: My mum was a big fan of James Dean. Even though I couldn’t watch all of his movies I really liked the strong, rebellious spirit in his eyes. I thought his attitude is just like my motto when I create music. I want to make rebellious and experimental music rather than common or stereotypical music. That’s why I chose the name Dean as my stage name.
</p>
<p><b> Taylor: Your EP contains a track entitled Bonnie & Clyde and they, alongside James Dean, had precarious lives and died young, violent deaths – is there a particular mystique about them that you’re drawn to?
</b></p>
<p>Dean: I was looking for the right concept for the EP album TRBL, which is short for ‘trouble’. I wanted to create my own original story in trapsoul music, which has become quite common these days. As a kid, I really liked telling stories with paintings or articles and for Bonnie & Clyde I wanted to create my version of the story of a fatal couple.
</p>
<p><b>Taylor: You’ve worked on some amazing collaborations, particularly with Heize on And July. What do you as an artist get from working closely with someone who is also new to the industry?
</b></p>
<p>Dean: It doesn’t matter to me whether that artist is new or a veteran, Heize has an interesting voice and she was new. So I thought it would be fun if I made her some trendy music and gave her a new image. I’m always looking for collaborations that will be fun, like that.
</p>
<p><b>Taylor: On 130 Mood: TRBL, you tell a love story in reverse. What was the idea behind this? Why was it important that the listener ended up at the point where love begins?
</b></p>
<p>Dean: Actually, there are a lot of stories in TRBL, I have a lot of regrets from that time because I was a troublemaker. I made TRBL by cutting out my heart for everyone to see. I wrote about a lot of my personal experiences in that project and TRBL means many things. I also love to do things differently and kind of in the opposite way. This was my first album so I wanted to make the project like me. For example, if you check my Instagram you will see a lot of the pictures are upside down – I always like to see things from different perspectives. I wrote a lot about my personal experiences and gave the project my personality in a lot of ways. I thought TRBL could explain a lot about me.
</p>
<p><b>Taylor: As more and more artists and producers experiment with bringing together different genres, yourself included, how do you keep pushing forward sonically? Do you continually tinker with music programs, do you listen to a lot of new music or old music?
</b></p>
<p>Dean: Yes, I’m always digging through old and indie music. I try to listen to ‘good’ music rather than trendy music – there’s no special reason for that. Doesn’t it make you happy when you listen to really good music? I get new ideas and inspiration from great music, and it makes me feel good.
</p>
<p><b>Taylor: You’re working on new material… what can you tell me about that? Is the sound a continuation of the mix of elements found on EP, or have you been working on something markedly different?
</b></p>
<p>Dean: I would call it an alternative hip hop/R&B album. I want to make sure it has great quality of sound for both Korea and internationally. When I was younger I thought I could try to understand US culture by listening to N*E*R*D. It would be great if people from other countries wanted to try to learn and understand more about Korean culture by listening to my music. I want to make that happen.
